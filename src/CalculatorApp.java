//This calculator app will take user input, remember it, select a mathematical operator and display the answer
//after the answer is displayed, it will need to ask if the user would like to calculate anything else

//First, I imported a scanner so I could remember my users input. If the user wants to perform: +-* or /, the calculator will
//ask them to input 2 numbers
